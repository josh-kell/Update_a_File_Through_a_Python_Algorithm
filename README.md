# Update a File Through a Python Algorithm

## Scenario

You are a security professional working at a health care company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list

The task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, those IP addresses should be removed from the file containing the allow list.

## Project Description

At my organization, access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses. The `"allow_list.txt"` file identifies these IP addresses. A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have access to this content. I created an algorithm to automate updating the `"allow_list.txt"` file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access. 

## Open the file that contains the allow list

For the first part of the algorithm, I opened the `"allow_list.txt"` file. First, I assigned this file name as a string to the `import_file` variable:

```#Assign `import_file' to the name of the file```
```import_file = "allow_list.txt"```
